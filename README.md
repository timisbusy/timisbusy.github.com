# timisbusy.github.com

This is the source code for http://timisbusy.github.com, built using github pages.

## Take It

You can clone this site, which uses the backbone.js framework and handlebars.js templates to build your own github pages project using:

> git clone git:github.com/timisbusy/timisbusy.github.com

Just pop it into a branch called gh-pages on your repository, or create a new repo called {your_github_username}.github.com, and it'll just pop up! Details at http://github.com/ghpages
